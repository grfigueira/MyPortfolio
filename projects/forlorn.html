            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
                We were tasked with creating a short and simple 3D
                platforming game just to get us started with game
                development. Since I was playing around with a shooting
                mechanic I decided to make a Doom(2016) like game that mixes
                platforming with shooting. It's a very short game!

                    I want to clarify that my version of the wave function
                    collapse algorithm does not use a reference image or perform
                    overlap checking to generate unique tiles and assign weights
                    based on their frequency in the image. Instead, I started
                    small and created my own tiles.

                    My game was already running smooth, but I wanted to see if I
                    could do even better by switching to another spatial data
                    structure. I decided to add a quadtree to compare the frames
                    between it and the spatial hash that I was already using.

                What I learned

            <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
                <!--In this project, I learned a lot when it comes to profiling,
                    optimizing, and handling memory, which is a personal
                    interest for me. I also gained a deeper understanding of the
                    wave function collapse algorithm and hope to continue
                    learning and experimenting with it in the future. <br /> -->
                In this project, I learned how useful prototyping can be and
                how much time and effort it can save in the long run. It was
                generally a fun and simple project so that weren't really
                many exciting technical challenges I can mention.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
                Considering this was a university project, it made me
                actually be able to finish the game instead of throwing it
                in my unfinished game projects pile. And this was a big
                lesson for me! Making games with smaller scopes and actually
                finishing them is usually better than working on overly
                ambitious projects that will invevitably never see the light
                of day.
