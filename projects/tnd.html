                    The Naturals' Descent was developed as a group project

            <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
                This was the bigger final project for the <b>Games and Simulations</b> university course.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
                We were given
                full creative freedom with only a few more technical requirements like:
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 text-gray-300 text-xl">
                <li>Cheat mode to jump to interesting evaluation points using keys 1, 2, 3, 4 or M, N, B, V, etc.</li>
                <li>Press ‚ÄòU‚Äô to toggle a free moving camera with mouse and WASD controls.</li>
                <li>Press ‚ÄòP‚Äô to pause the game (stop every animation) but still allow you to freely explore with the
                    camera using ‚ÄòU‚Äô.</li>
                <li>Toggle frames per second display using the ‚ÄòI‚Äô key.</li>

                We decided to try to make an action-adventure first person shooter, set in a steampunk desert world. The
                player can explore the desert in a hover board, fight AI enemies and solve puzzles inside of
                procidureally generated underground mazes.

                The Hover Board Mechanic
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
                For exploring the desert, we wanted the player to be able to ride some kind of vehicle. We decided that
                a hover board would be a cool and fitting choice for our steampunk world. The mechanic was inspired by
                the hover bike found in the game <i>Sable</i>.

                Wave Function Collapse
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
                For the underground caverns, we knew we wanted them to be procedurally generated. I challenged myself to
                implement this procedural generation using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
                Because of the project's ever closing deadline and since we didn't really need verticality in the
                caverns, I applied the 2 dimensions version of the algorithm using 3d meshes as the possible tiles.

                What I learned
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                <!--In this project, I learned a lot when it comes to profiling,
                    optimizing, and handling memory, which is a personal
                    interest for me. I also gained a deeper understanding of the
                    wave function collapse algorithm and hope to continue
                    learning and experimenting with it in the future. <br /> -->
                In this project, I learned how useful prototyping can be and
                how much time and effort it can save in the long run. It was
                generally a fun and simple project so that weren't really
                many exciting technical challenges I can mention.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Considering this was a university project, it made me
                actually be able to finish the game instead of throwing it
                in my unfinished game projects pile. And this was a big
                lesson for me! Making games with smaller scopes and actually
                finishing them is usually better than working on overly
                ambitious projects that will invevitably never see the light
                of day.
